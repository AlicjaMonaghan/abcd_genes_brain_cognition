**Data Availability Statement**

This work uses neuroimaging, genetic, and cognitive data from 2154 children from the baseline time point of the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development 
(ABCD) study, Release 4 (http://dx.doi.org/10.15154/1523041). Access to ABCD can be requested here: https://nda.nih.gov/nda/access-data-info.html. Since ABCD is 
an open-access initiative, to reproduce our results, we provide the following derived data: structural connectomes generated by deterministic tractography 
in QSIprep 0.15.3 (Cieslak et al., 2021), framewise displacement from QSIprep, age in months, sex, site ID (recoded into random letters), polygenic scores for 
cognitive ability (calculated using a tutorial from Choi and colleagues, 2020, Nature Protocols, 15, 2759-2772), general g factor of cognitive 
ability (derived from a principal component analysis of 7 NIH Toolbox cognitive assessements of working memory, attention, executive function, and language). 
Note that all data from ABCD is anonymised, and no subject IDs are included. We've also undertaken additional anonymisation steps, such as recoding 
scanner site.
